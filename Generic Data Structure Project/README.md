# **Generic Data Structures Library in C++**

### **Project Overview**

This project is a **Generic Data Structures Library** implemented in C++ using templates. The library provides commonly used data structures, such as Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues, with generic support for various data types. It is designed to be flexible, reusable, and efficient, ensuring that developers can use it in a variety of applications without having to rewrite core data structures for different data types.

### **Project Objective**

The main objective of this project is to create a versatile library that can be used to efficiently manage and manipulate different types of data. This project aims to provide:
- **Reusability:** The same data structures can be used for multiple data types (integers, strings, floats, etc.) without rewriting the code.
- **Efficiency:** The library is optimized to perform operations like insertion, deletion, and searching quickly and efficiently.
- **Modularity:** Each data structure is implemented as a separate class, ensuring that the code is organized and maintainable.
- **Scalability:** The generic nature of the library allows it to scale easily for various real-world applications.

### **Scope of the Project**

This library is designed to be used by developers and programmers in various fields, such as systems programming, application development, and algorithm implementation. By providing generic, flexible data structures, it reduces development time and allows programmers to focus on higher-level logic without worrying about the underlying data manipulation.

### **Data Structures and Functions**

#### 1. **Linked List**
   - **Functions:**
     - `void insert(T data)`: Inserts an element at the end of the list.
     - `void remove(T data)`: Removes the first occurrence of the specified element.
     - `bool search(T data)`: Searches for an element in the list and returns `true` if found.
     - `void display()`: Displays the elements of the list.
   - **Description:** Implements a singly linked list with operations to insert, remove, and search for elements.

#### 2. **Stack**
   - **Functions:**
     - `void push(T data)`: Pushes an element onto the stack.
     - `T pop()`: Removes the top element from the stack and returns it.
     - `T top()`: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
     - `bool isEmpty()`: Checks if the stack is empty.
   - **Description:** Implements a stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out) data structure with basic stack operations.

#### 3. **Queue**
   - **Functions:**
     - `void enqueue(T data)`: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
     - `T dequeue()`: Removes the front element from the queue and returns it.
     - `T front()`: Returns the front element of the queue without removing it.
     - `bool isEmpty()`: Checks if the queue is empty.
   - **Description:** Implements a queue (FIFO - First In, First Out) data structure with basic queue operations.

### **Project Use Cases**

- **Software Development:** Useful in any software that requires efficient data management, such as game development, web applications, and systems programming.
- **Algorithm Implementation:** Can be used to implement algorithms requiring dynamic data structures (e.g., stacks for depth-first search, queues for breadth-first search).
- **Education:** This library provides a foundational understanding of how data structures work, which is useful for students and developers learning about data structures and algorithms.

### **Advantages of the Project**

1. **Generic Programming:** The use of templates makes the library versatile, allowing it to work with any data type, including user-defined types.
2. **Modular Design:** Each data structure is implemented as a separate class, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
3. **Optimized for Performance:** The library is designed with performance in mind, ensuring that data structure operations like insertion, deletion, and searching are efficient.
4. **Extensibility:** New data structures can easily be added to the library without affecting the existing ones.
5. **Flexibility:** The library can be integrated into various types of applications, from simple programs to complex systems, without modifications.

### **Future Enhancements**

- **Add more data structures** such as Binary Search Trees, Hash Tables, and Graphs to the library.
- **Improve algorithm efficiency** by implementing more advanced techniques for sorting, searching, and traversing data structures.
- **Add thread-safe versions** of the data structures for use in multi-threaded applications.
- **Provide better memory management** with smart pointers or custom allocators.
